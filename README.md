# HandWrittenDigitPrediction

OBJECTIVE:
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It involves preprocessing the data, training a Logistic Regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing results. The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of digits (0-9) represented as 28x28 pixel arrays, making it an ideal dataset for image classification tasks.

APPLICATION:
 *Handwritten digit recognition systems (e.g., postal code sorting, bank check processing).
 *Serves as a foundational project for understanding multi-class classification problems.
 *Illustrates the use of Logistic Regression for image classification tasks.
